<br><br>**Aleksandra Pękowska, PI**

I graduated from the University of Lodz with a MS in biology (spec. biophysics, lab of Prof. Grzegorz Bartosz, Dept. of Molecular Biophysics) in 2006. For my Ph.D., I joined the lab of Dr. Pierre Ferrier  at the CIML in Marseilles. Combining a variety of high throughput genome analysis approaches (including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and microarray-based assays) and computational biology tools, we discovered a chromatin signature allowing to distinguish active from poised enhancers (Pękowska A. et al., 2011, *EMBO Journal*). In a purely in silico study, we show for the first time, that tissue-specific genes display a unique pattern of histone modifications (Pękowska A. et al., 2010 *Genome Research*). 

In 2011, I obtained the EIPOD fellowship (EMBL/Marie Curie actions) and joined groups of Dr. Wolfgang Huber, Dr. Lars Steinmetz, and Dr. Paul Bertone at EMBL/EBI for an interdisciplinary postdoc. My goal was to define the relationship between cellular plasticity and chromatin topology. Using stem cell models and in-situ Hi-C, we revealed that differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to neuronal lineage coincides with a genome-wide buildup of chromatin loops and strengthening of chromatin boundaries (Pękowska A. et al., *Cell Systems*). 

In 2016, I joined the team of Dr. Rafael Casellas at NIAMS (NIH) in Bethesda, US. In a recent paper, we described architectural stripes - specialized chromatin structures frequently involving super-enhancers (Vian L.#, Pękowska A.# et al. 2018 *Cell*, # equal contribution). Combining CRISPR-Cas9, Hi-C and ChIP-seq, we show that stripes rely on the action of CTCF and cohesins; and that their formation requires constant energy input. 

In my spare time, I enjoy astronomy, history, and hiking.

<br><br>**Aleksandra Piotrowska, Research Technician**

I am interested in the molecular bases of inheritance, in particular, in how epigenetics shapes the identity of a cell. 

In 2019, I obtained a Master’s Degree in Molecular Biotechnology at the University of Warsaw.  My project was aimed at the development of molecular biology methods to diagnose chosen rare genetic disorders.

I joined the Dioscuri Centre for Chromatin Biology and Epigenomics in Fall 2019. I derive and maintain induced pluripotent stem cell lines from mammals (mouse, primates, and humans). I am still learning about their needs and moods. I am also responsible for the technical infrastructure in the lab.

Besides my implication in the lab, I study bioethics at the University of Warsaw. I am interested in ethical aspects of biotechnology in particular, the moral implications of the use of human ES cells and of human genome editing.

<br><br>**Peyman Zare, Research Technician**

I received a DVM degree from The School of Veterinary Medicine, Shiraz University in Iran under the supervision of Prof. Naser Vesal. I was interested in avian anesthesia and analgesia (Vesal N, Zare P. 2006 Vet Anaesth Analg). I obtained a PhD in Microbiology from The Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Urmia University in Iran, under the supervision of Prof. Mohammad Tabatabaei. I was interested in the genetics of avian disease-causing agent Pasteurella multocida (Zare P. et al. 2008 J Anim Vet Adv). 

In 2002, I joined The University of Tabriz in Iran as a Microbiology Lecturer (2002-2007). After a sabbatical at the group of Prof. Ivan Rychlik at the Veterinary Research Institute, Brno, in the Czech Republic, I came back to Iran and was appointed the position of an Assistant Professor (2008-2015) and later an Associate Professor (2015-2017). My research interests were mainly focusing on the interactions between cancer cells and bacterial components (Jahanban-Esfahlan R. et al. 2017 Scientific reports; Seidi K. et al. 2018 Oncogene). I published some of my most recent work in the form of review articles (Jahanban-Esfahlan A. et al. 2019 Cancers; Jahanban-Esfahlan R. et al. 2019 Journal of Controlled Release; Ayoubi‐Joshaghani MH. et al. 2020 Biotechnology and Bioengineering).

I recently joined the Dioscuri Center of Chromatin Biology and Epigenomics. I work on primary and iPS cell-derived neural cells. I am interested in the the evolutionary mechanisms that drive the diversification of astrocytes in humans.

<br><br>**Marcin Janowski, PostDoc**

For my PhD I joined Marek Mutwil’s lab at the Max Planck institute for Molecular Plant Physiology in Potsdam. I focused on the biology of AtRsgA - an essential ribosomal GTPase. Due to its role in rRNA maturation, I had the opportunity to develop strong skills in molecular biology and protein biochemistry. I was also involved in the generation and interpretation of “omics” data (RNA-seq, Mass-spec).

Currently, my interests focus on proteins implicated in the regulation of chromatin topology. Using high-throughput techniques, I aim to uncover new mechanisms that govern the dynamics of chromatin organization during the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells to neurons. In particular, I would like to identify novel factors involved in the regulation of CTCF-bound chromatin insulators.

<br><br>**Katarzyna Ciuba, PostDoc**

I have graduated as a MSc of Biochemistry at Jagiellonian University in Cracow. Then, I joined Pekka Lappalainen's lab at the University of Helsinki as a PhD student. I took advantage of a wide range of cell biology, microscopy and biochemistry methods to unravel mechanisms regulating assembly and function of contractile actin-based structures in non-muscle cells.

Currently, I am interested in functional genomics of astrocytes. Taking advantage of genome editing methods accompanied by broad molecular biology and microscopy techniques, I aim to decipher the role of certain astrocyte genes in functional and evolutionary context. 

In my spare time I experiment with coffee and travels.

<br><br>**Anna Trzeciecka, Research Staff**

My training is in medicine (MD, Medical University of Warsaw) and bioinformatics (MS, Johns Hopkins University). As an undergraduate, I gained molecular biology research experience in the Department of Immunology, Medical University of Warsaw, and in the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Eastern Finland. Subsequently, I pursued a research fellowship at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami, where I investigated lipid and protein profiles upon optic nerve regeneration.

Currently, my research focuses on evolutionary changes of astrocytes. Using bioinformatics and experimental approaches, I am studying interspecies gene expression patterns to provide a mechanistic account for unique phenotypic features of human astrocytes.

<br><br>**Malgorzata Milewska, PhD student**


In 2019 I graduated from Warsaw University of Life Sciences with a Master's degree majoring in Molecular Biology. During my MSc studies, I worked on the detection of protein-protein interaction using a two-hybrid system. I determined a potential function of a few parasite antigens which have a significant role during Toxocara canis invasion in the human organism. 
Currently I participate in a project on the regulation of chromatin topology. I am interested in the three-dimensional structure of the genome and the regulation of gene expression during development. Using high-throughput sequencing technologies, I would like to answer the question of how the factors associated with the CTCF influence cell development. 
In my spare time, I am a big fan of good cuisine and long walks.

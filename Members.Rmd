<br><br>**Aleksandra Pękowska, Ph.D.**

I graduated from the University of Lodz with a MS in biology (spec. biophysics, lab of Prof. Grzegorz Bartosz, Dept. of Molecular Biophysics) in 2006. For my Ph.D., I joined the lab of Dr. Pierre Ferrier  at the CIML in Marseilles. Combining a variety of high throughput genome analysis approaches (including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and microarray-based assays) and computational biology tools, we discovered a chromatin signature allowing to distinguish active from poised enhancers (Pękowska A. et al., 2011, *EMBO Journal*). In a purely in silico study, we show for the first time, that tissue-specific genes display a unique pattern of histone modifications (Pękowska A. et al., 2010 *Genome Research*). 

In 2011, I obtained the EIPOD fellowship (EMBL/Marie Curie actions) and joined groups of Dr. Wolfgang Huber, Dr. Lars Steinmetz, and Dr. Paul Bertone at EMBL/EBI for an interdisciplinary postdoc. My goal was to define the relationship between cellular plasticity and chromatin topology. Using stem cell models and in-situ Hi-C, we revealed that differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to neuronal lineage coincides with a genome-wide buildup of chromatin loops and strengthening of chromatin boundaries (Pękowska A. et al., *Cell Systems*). 

In 2016, I joined the team of Dr. Rafael Casellas at NIAMS (NIH) in Bethesda, US. In a recent paper, we described architectural stripes - specialized chromatin structures frequently involving super-enhancers (Vian L.#, Pękowska A.# et al. 2018 *Cell*, # equal contribution). Combining CRISPR-Cas9, Hi-C and ChIP-seq, we show that stripes rely on the action of CTCF and cohesins; and that their formation requires constant energy input. 

In my spare time, I enjoy astronomy, history, and hiking.

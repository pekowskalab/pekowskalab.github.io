## Ph.D. students
We are seeking two Ph.D. students to join our lab and to identify and characterize genetic and epigenetic bases of astrocyte identity and functions. The successful candidates will be using cutting edge high throughput sequencing based methods (ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, Hi-C) and cellular models to decipher the regulatory principles underlying astrocyte biology in mammals.
